		Team Pineapple review of Team Awesome
-	VS may be able to make diagrams itself.
-	had questions about which were client/host classes
-	asked about if we had constructors
-	rename filenames so that it's easier to find classes from diagrams
-	asked about handles, how they interract with buttons (may be a VB specific thing)
-	suggests "n"(variable) should be more descriptive
-	(detech closed sockets so that they arnt used)(set them to NULL)
-	understand better, the code we borrowed from other places



		reviewing Troy IN Action

-	asked about some features
-	More comments explainning what some functions are doing
	(either a large description before function, or smaller ones throughout)
-	Some variable names weren't descriptive enough (newa tho to be fair makes sense if
	HTML didn't name links with <a>)
-	CSS wasn't commented, but we didin't feel it necessary (CSS fairly straighforward)
-	A section was copied pasted, maybe reduce that somehow to reduce size
-	possibly use a side file to describe what functions do (since they dont want comments
	in their HTML)
-	declare variables together, instead of being introduced throughout code
-	otherwise, formatted consistantly and straightforward code
