TTGMaster allows multiple users to connect to one host and play a game together. In order to do this one player must act as the host and create the game so that others may join.

# You Will Need #

One player to host the game. All players need to have a connection to the internet. The host and players will also need several images to display as the game board and game pieces. We recommend the host to send a zip file containing all the pieces to every player.

# Creating a Game #

Start by clicking on **File** -> **Connect**.  This will bring up a box where you can choose to Host Game or Connect to Game. Choose the **Host Game** option.

![http://i39.tinypic.com/15rjf6h.jpg](http://i39.tinypic.com/15rjf6h.jpg)

Click on the **Host Game** radio button.

The **IP** field should display the IP address for other players to connect to. If your internet connection goes through a router however, you may need to find your IP via other methods. We recommend http://whatsmyip.org. If you forget your IP address, the **View** -> **Show my IP** option will display it.

The **Game Name** option is the name you would like your game called.

**User Name** is the name which you would like to be referred to by.

**Port** number is the port you want people to connect through. This is important,
make sure to give this value to those you want to join, as they will need it to connect to your game.

Once all needed information is given, finish creating your game by clicking the **Connect** button.

**Troubleshooting** - If you receive an error message in red "Could not connect..." it may be that you have chosen an invalid or already in use Port value. Try using another Port.

# Joining a Game #

Start by ensuring that the host has already created a game, and obtain the following information from them: **IP address** to connect to and **Port number** to connect with.

The **IP** option specifies which IP address to connect to. Obtain this from the game's host and place that value here. It is required to join the game.

**User Name** is the name which you would like to be referred to by.

**Port** number is the port you connect to the host through. Obtain this from the host as well, it is also required.

Once all needed information is given, join the game by clicking the **Connect** button.
