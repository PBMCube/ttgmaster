*#imagefile* represents the board object, loaded from imagefile.

*@imagefile* represents an piece added, using the image at imagefile.

*&imagefile* represents a die object added, imagefile being the specific image that TTGMaster uses for its die image of the specified side size.

The *asterisks* followed by numbers represent a piece being moved.
First number is piece number, second is x position moved to, and third number is y position moved to.

These commands can also be typed in for manual moving of pieces.

One can manually roll dice using the *roll #d#* command. Replace the first # with the number of dice to be rolled and the second # with how many sides each die has. For example, entering "roll 2d6" into the chat-box will return a roll value of 2 6-sided dice rolled.
